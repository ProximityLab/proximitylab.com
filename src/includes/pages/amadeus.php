      <p class="module-fade">Amadeus Hospitality is the world’s leading provider of hospitality management software with a suite of tools that empowers hotel staff to manage virtually every aspect of the hotel experience. Amadeus turned to Proximity Lab to modernize several applications related to event planning and management.</p>
      <p class="module-fade">Before redesigning the user experience, we researched the market and interviewed customers to analyze existing products, understand customer needs and evaluate idealized feature sets. That work was critical in driving the focus and direction of the project including:</p>

    <h2 class="module-fade">Re-crafting an integrated experience</h2>
    <p class="module-fade">As our teams moved into the UX and interface design phases, we collaborated with Amadeus stakeholders to develop a clear vision for an integrated suite of products that would span event planning, event layout and design, sales, operations management and collaboration. The products we designed ranged from a wholesale redesign of Amadeus’ online space planner added to their product portfolio through acquisition to the design of new products including their Planner Portal and Direct Book solutions.</p>
    <p class="module-fade">In each case, Proximity Lab approached product design with an eye toward improving customer experience and advancing the business goals of Amadeus’ customers. The resulting event planning &amp; management suite features tightly integrated and unified workflows and consistent visual design that provides an effective and seamless end-to-end experience for customers.</p>
