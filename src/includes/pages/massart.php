      <p>Proximity Lab is a participatory installation and experimental interface platform designed to visualize relationships between users and mediated spaces. Built on the premise that physical proximity is a basic unit of social communication, this study examines the role that unconscious and dynamically created personal space plays in social interaction. The experiment also studies user engagement and response where interface conventions and rules are not explicitly disclosed.</p>

      <p>The study explores the relationships between disclosure and participation through interfaces that promote self-directed exploration. Do increased levels of participation and collaboration occur when users are allowed to innovate and create new relationships with the system? Can interactive systems leave room for users to interpret and adopt new uses not envisioned by the designer?</p>
      <p>Such collaborations between system architect and participant are explored as a model for elevating interactive experience design and self-directed exploration. The study explores a number of interaction design issues including:</p>
