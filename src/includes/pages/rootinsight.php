      <p class="module-fade">Measuring and comparing the health of start-up businesses is challenging. Each uses slightly different metrics to report progress and they use different reporting tools to consolidate them.</p>
      <p class="module-fade">The Root Insight team envisioned a platform that was specifically built to normalize company performance metrics to give investors, board members and the operating teams a much clearer perspective about how their performance compares to similarly sized organizations in their specific vertical market and across a portfolio companies that may span multiple vertical markets. The team at Root Insight chose Proximity Lab to design and develop this platform.</p>
      <p class="module-fade">To ensure that the platform would deliver the most value, our team worked with leading business analysts to better understand vital business metrics – how they are measured and how they are reported. We evaluated existing business intelligence platforms and data visualization tools to understand the best methods to convey and compare business performance.</p>
