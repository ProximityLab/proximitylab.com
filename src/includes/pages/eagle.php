      <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Cambridge UK based Eagle Genomics is an award-winning provider of AI-powered analysis tools designed to drive and accelerate genomics research. Its products are used by some of the largest and most-respected life science companies in the world.  In an effort to expand their product portfolio, Eagle developed a concept for an app that allows researchers to perform multi-dimensional analyses on massive sets of biological data and allow for increased efficiencies in the research process. Understanding that this new product would require innovative interface concepts and a specialized UX and interface design team, Eagle looked for a design partner and selected Proximity Lab to help drive the vision and experience.</p>

          <p>Our teams worked together to process the research, explore feature and workflow ideas and develop a set of UX recommendations. The centerpiece of this work, one that offered the greatest value to target users, involved a concept for conversational UI and an interactive canvas-based visual modeling experience for genomic researchers and scientists to use to identify new drug discovery insights.</p>
          <p>The new platform was purpose-built to improve the efficiency of existing processes and allow teams to collaborate and accelerate and manage their research projects as never before. Some highlights of the work include:</p>
